# Gyatt 2
Gyatt (Gee-yacht) is **the** Python-based programming language of the future.
<br><sub><sub><sup>Please don't use this, **especially** if you don't know what these terms mean</sup></sub></sub>

## Erm, what the sigma ü§ì?
Python, traditionally considered "easy" and "intuitive," uses too many archaic words like `print` and `math`. I wanted to fix this and keep Python in line with modern  English.

Gyatt is designed with a focus on readability, speed, and function.
The following is a tiny sample of Gyatt:
```js
aldi nerd propertyinegypt pi like pie rn
waffle about pie rn

yapuntil nocap aint be cap tho
	waffle about "you know whats crazy is that the low taper fade meme is still massive" rn
	stawp rn

skibidi? 1 be 1 rn

x finna mew x tho x sigma 1 rn
waffle about x(1) rn

choppedchin tho
	waffle about 1/0 rn
boom ZeroDivisionError tho
	waffle about "IVE PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORE" rn
frfr tho
	waffle about 'I SAID IVE PLAYED THESE GAMES BEFORE' rn
```

Although Gyatt code is easily readable by most people, a tiny minority may fail to understand it. The following is a translation guide for Gyatt:

```python
rizz - None
cap - False
nocap - True
btw - and
like - as
skibidi - assert
stawp - break
period - continue
gyatt - def
hawktuah - elif
tuah - else
boom - except
frfr - finally
iveplayedthesegamesbefore - for
aldi - from
hawk - if
propertyinegypt - import
be - ==
huzz - lambda
nogatekeep - nonlocal
nogatekeepfrfr - global
aint - not
idk - or
idc - pass
lowtaperfade - raise
yeet - return
choppedchin - try
yapuntil - while
chill - yield
nerd - math
finna - =
rn - "" # required, but gets removed in translation
tho - : # colon in if, while, lambda, etc. statements
sigma - +
times - range
```

## my cutie pattotie, how do I start ü´∂?

The Gyatt Compiler(`gyatt.py`) is written in Python, and therefore, you will need [Python](https://www.python.org/) to run Gyatt. Next, clone this repository. Then, write some Gyatt code or use the example `code.gyt` file provided and run `python3 gyatt.py code.gyt`.

More advanced users can also add `gyatt` as an alias for `python3 gyatt.py` in their terminal profile to run Gyatt code more easily‚Äî`gyatt code.gyt`. 

## uwu üòä

Q: Erm ü§ì, wtf is going on with my strings?
<br>A: In Gyatt 2, a change was made to uwu-ify all strings by default. Ex (`how are you?` -> `h-how awe yoyu?`). Although highly recommended, this feature can be turned off with the `--nouwu` or `-n` command-line arguments.

## yo tengo une erreur de compiler üò°ü§¨üò†!!!

In Gyatt 2, you can specify a file to which python code will compile to by using a positional argument like `gyatt code.gyt argh` (compiled code will be saved in `argh.py`)

## top dos scariest hoompscahres üò±
The Gyatt Compiler requires you to end every line with either `tho` or `rn` for readability. However, be careful, as these are not interchangeable!! 
- `tho` is used as the colon(`:`) in Python (if, while, for, lambda, etc.)
- `rn` is used to signify the end of the line

## segfault üò≠
gyatt2 has a russian roullete system where it has a 1/6 chance of segfaulting

## Compatability
### pookie bear ü•∞, will my Gyatt 1 code work in Gyatt 2?
no

### will there be backwards compatability in the future
no

### will there be documentation on what changed
no

## Future changes (not happening)

1. Automatically add alias
2. ~~Add tokenization~~
3. ~~Custom Output~~
4. ~~UwUfication~~
5. Python to Gyatt
6. Multi-Word Tokenization
7. Emojification
8. completely ban comments (currently only heavily discouraged)
9. **randomly swap all variables in memory (in testing)**
