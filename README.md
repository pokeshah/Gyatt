# Gyatt
Gyatt (Gee-yacht) is the Python-based language of the future.
<br><sub><sup>This is satire; please don't use this, **especially** if you don't know what these terms mean</sup></sub>

## Why?
Python, a language traditionally thought of as "easy" and "intuitive," uses too many obscure words like `print()` and `math`. I wanted to fix this and keep Python in line with modern conversational English.

## What does Gyatt code look like?
Gyatt is designed with a focus on readability, speed, and function.
The following is sample code written in Gyatt (comments, although allowed, are generally not needed due to Gyatt's readable nature and are excluded from this example):

```gyatt
yoinked nerd steal pi masquerade pie
yap about pie rn

sus 1+2 be 3:
	yap about "3" rn
imposter 1+2 be 2 idk 1+2 be 4:
	yap about "2 idk 4" rn
crewmate:
	yap about "error" rn

yapuntil wrizz:
	yap about "among us" rn
	stawp

yapfor i infam range(10):
	sus i be 3:
		next
	imposter i be 5:
		stawp
	crewmate:
		whatever
	yap about i rn

gyatt rizzler():
	yeet "sticking out your gyatt for the rizzler"

yap about rizzler() rn

yolo:
	yap about 1/0 rn
oof ZeroDivisionError:
	yap about "fail" rn
frfr:
	yap about 'finally' rn

sus (0/3 be 0) also (0/4 be 0) also aint (1/4 be 0):
	yap about "success" rn

skibidi 1 be 1

gyatt we():
	chill "we live"
	chill "we love"
	chill "we lie"

yapfor i infam we():
	yap about i rn

x = anon x: x + 1
yap about x(1) rn

gyatt one():
	x = "1"
	gyatt two():
		nogatekeep x
		x = "2"
	two()
	yeet x
yap about one() rn

fanumtax Exception("haha get fanumtaxed!!!")
```
Although this code is easily readable by most of the English-speaking world, some cave-dwellers may fail to understand it. The following is a translation guide for Gyatt.
```python
lrizz — False
norizz — None
wrizz — True
also — and
masquerade — as
skibidi — assert
stawp — break
next — continue
gyatt — def
imposter — elif
crewmate — else
oof — except
frfr — finally
yapfor — for
yoinked — from
sus — if
steal — import
infam — in
be — ==
anon — lambda
nogatekeep — nonlocal
aint — not
idk — or
whatever — pass
fanumtax — raise
yeet — return
yolo — try
yapuntil — while
chill — yield
nerd — math
```

## OMG!! this looks so exciting! How do I start?
The Gyatt compiler(`gyatt.py`) is written in Python, and therefore, you will need [Python](https://www.python.org/) to run Gyatt. Next, clone this repository. Then, write some gyatt code or use the example `code.gyt` file provided and run `python3 gyatt.py code.gyt`. This will compile and execute the `.gyt` code.

### <u>Advanced</u> Usage
```
usage: gyatt.py [-h] [-o PATH] file

positional arguments:
  file

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  -o PATH, --out PATH  Compile and save the code into a Python script at PATH
```

Even more advanced users can also add `gyatt` as an alias for `python3 gyatt.py` in their terminal settings to run Gyatt code more easily—`gyatt code.gyt`.

## Future changes (not happening)

1. Add more Gyatt replacements
2. Automatically add alias
3. ~~Add tokenization~~
4. Get some help

# Yes, I am okay.
